I made this bot while trying to win the Virtual Piano 2016 World Championships. Macros were specifically allowed for the competition. I won the Christmas category (after they tried disqualifying March from The Nutcracker saying it wasn't a Christmas song) which netted me a $100 Amazon giftcard. Nice.

I used a tool called midicsv to help with translating MIDI files to something easier to work with for the program.

Here are videos of my submissions made with this bot:
